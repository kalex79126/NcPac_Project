## 4. Main Function and Description
As a team, we developed the project which involved creating a program to manage committee meetings. The main function of this project is to provide a functional program for Niagara College Program Advise Committee to use it for upcoming meetings and past meetings. This project required a keen understanding of application security and governance to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive meeting information. The system also prioritized risk reduction through the implementation of secure coding practices and continuous monitoring.
As the client requested, we added a feature of sending out emails to selected or all members of committees later in the project. Newsfeed feature is available for the members who are part of one or more commitee(s) to see upcoming meetings and their roles for the meetings. The following project was selected by the client out of 5 competitors and is now being used to manage the committee.
